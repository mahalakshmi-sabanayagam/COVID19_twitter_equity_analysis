# Sentiment analysis of COVID-19 related tweets and the impact on equities
In this [FTL Hackathon](https://bigdatahack.femaletechleaders.org/) project, we performed sentiment score analysis of tweets containing various hashtags related to COVID 19 (corona), lockdown announcements and other stock market related labels and analyze its impact on Dow Jones Industrial (DJI) stock index. The tweets were acquired in real time using `tweepy` API, sentiment analysis was performed using `nltk` library and the resulting data analytics results were stored in Google Sheets using a python script. We also show interactive data visualizations of the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the world (eg: GIS Choropleth plots) and other interesting plots for the twitter data analytics.
